# RFP-013: Cryptonet network grants

## Background
As part of [Cryptonet](https://cryptonet.org/)â€™s mission to improve the cryptographic building blocks for Web3 applications, we are very interested in funding research projects in this space and creating collaborations across companies and academia. If you are a researcher working on any Web3-related cryptographic problems, we encourage you to apply to one of our grants and become part of Cryptonet's extended community of researchers and collaborators.

## Network grants

A network grant is a mid-sized funding instrument intended to stimulate research on cryptographic problems arising from Web3 applications such as those listed below. We encourage applications that span the entire range of research projects, from theoretical foundational questions to applied implementation and experimental efforts. 

We aim to fund grants in the following areas: 

- SNARKs
- Vector commitments
- Multiparty computation
- Threshold cryptography
- Decentralized and anonymous authentication
- Fully homomorphic encryption
- Security against rational adversaries
- Quantum resistant cryptography
- Proofs of space

Funds can be used to support graduate students, the summer salaries of university faculty, travel to conferences and meetings, participation in summer schools and Web3 events, and fellowships for graduate students and postdocs. 

## Requirements

There are no strict requirements for funded researchers except an end-of-year report on the results of the project. This will be used to evaluate a potential renewal of the grant. 

While researchers are not expected to collaborate with Cryptonet staff, we will strongly encourage interactions between funded PIs and our team, and across the network of funded PIs. To that end, Cryptonet will organize events for the PIs to share their problems and progress and to foster collaboration.

## RFP details

### Application deadline
**Rolling**: We will be reviewing applications in batches corresponding to calendar months. The call will close on **July 30, 2023**, or earlier if the allocated funding is exhausted.

### Award
Commensurate with scope, up to $35,000 per award. We expect the typical grant to last one year (with possible renewal) and to funded $25,000 on average. 

### Payout schedule
Paid upon award.

### Point of contact
